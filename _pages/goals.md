title: Key Goals

These are the current, short term goals of the Australian Tech Lobby. These reflect the efforts we are putting in today, and will be throughout the end of the year. These goals may evolve over time as we identify new areas for the growth or new issues of importance to the Australian tech industry.

### Building our brand
As an organisation, we are still in our infancy. We are a grassroots movement, and as such we need to plant the seeds. This year, we will be looking to increase our recognition and membership among tech workers.

This means running a weekly newsletter, holding networking events, giving out merch and encouraging people to join. We know we have achieved this goal when we see that we have a sizable, passionate and engaged membership.

### Meaningful reform to the AA Bill
This is a goal that we will be working towards for a long time. The Telecommunications (Access and Assistance) Bill 2018 took a sledgehammer to our industry and left us to deal with the fallout.

We will be conducting grassroots campaigns to encourage members of the Australian Tech Lobby to contact their local members and senators and tell them just how damaging this legislation is.

We want to see meaningful reform to the legislation, including protection for individual workers.

### Understanding where workers go when they move jobs
Despite the great talent we have here in Australia, many engineers, designers and product managers choose to work at large companies instead of joining a startup or starting their own company.

At any given point in time, one in three Aussies think they have a great business idea<sup>1</sup>. We want to understand what primarily motivates people when they change jobs so we can advocate effectively for people to join smaller companies or even start their own.
