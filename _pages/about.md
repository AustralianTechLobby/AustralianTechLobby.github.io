Even though we are still young as an organisation, we have lofty ambitions. This is what we are working to achieve in the long term:

### For workers
- Support action by workers against employers that breach professional ethics (eg Google opposition to Maven)
- Connect employees to businesses that are hiring in Australia
- Networking events and hackathons

### For businesses
- Provide documentation on how to start a small business (how to get an ABN, register articles of incorporation, how to effectively recruit, interview and hire)
- Advocate for the businesses that do not have the economies of scale to do so themselves.
- Provide access to talented candidates and capital in order to grow and expand

### For the industry
- Advocating for strong, consistent, clear government policy that empowers the tech industry in Australia and allows it to compete on the global stage
- A unified, apolitical voice for the tech industry in Australia
