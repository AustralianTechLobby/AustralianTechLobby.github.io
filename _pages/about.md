Even though we are still young as an organisation, we have lofty ambitions. This is what we are working to achieve in the long term:

### For workers
- Support action by workers against employers that breach their professional ethics.
- Connect employees to businesses that are hiring in Australia.
- Networking events and hackathons.

### For businesses
- Provide documentation on how to start a small business.
- Advocate for the businesses that do not have the economies of scale to do so themselves.
- Provide access to talented candidates and capital in order to grow and expand.

### For the industry
- Advocating for strong, consistent, clear government policy that empowers the tech industry in Australia and encourages success of local businesses on the global stage.
- A unified, apolitical voice for the tech industry in Australia.
