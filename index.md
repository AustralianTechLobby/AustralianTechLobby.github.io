Welcome to the Australian Tech Lobby. We are a grassroots organisation that advocates for workers in the Australian Tech Industry, as well as the industry as a whole.

We advocate for a fair go for engineers, designers, product managers, researchers, data scientists, managers, and anyone who works in the tech industry. We are a voice for workers against exploitative behaviour by employers, and a voice for the industry to the government, advocating for policy that supports a vibrant, thriving tech industry in Australia.
